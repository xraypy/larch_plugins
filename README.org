* Larch plugins

  This repository contains additional plugins developed for [[http://xraypy.github.com/xraylarch][Larch]]. A a brief description is given in the following, but the best is to read directly the ~__doc__~ strings in the source code. The Python files have a test/example included in the ~__main__~ block, while an additional Larch script, called ~pluginname_test.lar~, does the same with the domain specific language (DSL).

** ~specfile.py~

   To read SPEC files from Certified Scientific Software (http://www.certif.com/)

*** Notes
    
    Regarding the Python class to read SPEC files, I have evaluated:

    1) specfilewrapper in PyMca (rewritten in Python from the 'specfile' C class developed at ESRF)
    2) pyspec ([[http://pythonhosted.org/pyspec/]])
    3) specparser ([[https://github.com/tpikonen/specparser]])
    4) the one included in TDL ([[https://github.com/xraypy/tdl]])

    To my opinion, (1) is the best choice for simplicity, versatility and maintenance. (2) is a nice project too but cannot handle motors names that include a dot, as 'Mono.Energy'.
