* Mauro's Larch plugins

  This repository contains additional plugins developed for [[http://xraypy.github.com/xraylarch][Larch]]. A a
  brief description is given in the following, but the best is to read
  directly the ~__doc__~ strings in the source code. The Python files
  have a test/example included in the ~__main__~ block, while an
  additional Larch script, called ~pluginname_test.lar~, does the same
  with the domain specific language (DSL).

  To report bugs, enhancements or comments, please use the [[https://github.com/maurov/larch_plugins/issues][Issues]].

** Specfile

   To read SPEC files from Certified Scientific Software
   (http://www.certif.com/)

*** Notes
    
    Regarding the Python class to read SPEC files, I have evaluated:

    1) *specfilewrapper* from PyMca (rewritten in Python from the
       ~specfile~ C class developed at ESRF)
    2) *pyspec* ([[http://pythonhosted.org/pyspec/]])
    3) *specparser* ([[https://github.com/tpikonen/specparser]])
    4) *specfile*, the one included in TDL
       ([[https://github.com/xraypy/tdl]])

    To my opinion, (1) is the best choice for simplicity, versatility
    and maintenance. (2) is a nice project too but cannot handle
    motors names that include a dot, as e.g. 'Mono.Energy'.

* Future plugins

  Here a list (_without order_) of future plugins that could help the
  daily work of x-ray spectroscopists (contributions are welcome!):

  - basic operations on XES (x-ray emission spectroscopy) and RIXS
    (resonant inelastic x-ray scattering) data files: normalization,
    merge, dichroism, convolution/deconvolution
  - implement IAD (integral of the absolute difference) data analysis
    for XES
  - interacting with theoretical softwares: FDMNES, FEFF, GPAW, ASE
